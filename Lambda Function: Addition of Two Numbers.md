# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
a=int(input()) 
b=int(input()) 
f=lambda a,b: a+b 
print(f(a,b) 

## Output

## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
